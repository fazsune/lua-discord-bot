# General Purpose Discord Bot

##### *The fourth generation of my long-running, Lua-written Discord bot project.*

This bot combines all of the updates and improvements made across all of my branched out Discord bot projects, mainly from [Heavy Dictator](https://github.com/EpicFazbear/heavy-dictator-bot) and the [Remote Communications bot](https://github.com/EpicFazbear/remote-comms-bot).

- Requires [Luvit](https://luvit.io/) in order to run. (Use the command `lit install` to download other dependencies such as [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia))
- Configurable in the .env file. (Optionally, use a .env manager such as dotenvx to handle environment variables)
